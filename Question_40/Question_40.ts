//Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name
//and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. 
//Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
//Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
//Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
//If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, 
//add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
interface Album {
    artist: string;
    title: string;
    tracks?: number; //optional
}
